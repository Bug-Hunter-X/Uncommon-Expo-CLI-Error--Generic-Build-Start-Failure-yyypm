This error typically occurs when you're using an older version of Expo CLI or when there are inconsistencies between the packages installed in your project and the Expo CLI's expectations.  It might manifest during various Expo commands like `expo start`, `expo build`, or `expo prebuild`. The error message itself might not be very descriptive, often providing a generic error or pointing to an issue with a dependency.

Example (The exact error might differ):

```
Error: Command failed: ... some internal error message...
```
