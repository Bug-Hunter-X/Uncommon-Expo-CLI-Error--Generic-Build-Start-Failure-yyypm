# Uncommon Expo CLI Error: Generic Build/Start Failure

This repository demonstrates a scenario leading to an uncommon and unhelpful error message within the Expo CLI. The error typically arises from dependency or version mismatches, making diagnosis difficult.  The example focuses on resolving issues that lead to generic error messages during `expo start` or `expo build`.

## Problem

Expo CLI might fail with a vague error message, obscuring the underlying cause.  This is frequently due to inconsistencies in package versions or missing dependencies.  The error might not directly point to the culprit, requiring careful investigation.

## Solution

The solution focuses on ensuring correct package versions and resolving any dependency conflicts.  This might involve:

* Checking `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`) for conflicts.
* Ensuring all dependencies are up-to-date using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`.
* Cleaning the project's cache using `expo prebuild --clean`.
* Reinstalling node modules using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
* Using Expo's diagnostic tools to pinpoint problems more precisely.
* Checking for breaking changes in Expo SDK versions and updating your project accordingly.

## How to reproduce (Illustrative):

1. Create an Expo project (using a potentially outdated Expo version).
2. Introduce a deliberate mismatch between packages (add a package, then remove it incompletely).
3. Try to run `expo start` or `expo build` and observe the generic error.
