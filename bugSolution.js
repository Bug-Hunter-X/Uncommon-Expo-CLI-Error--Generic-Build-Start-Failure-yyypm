To address this, meticulously examine your `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`) files. Look for any conflicting or outdated dependencies. Use `npm outdated` or `yarn outdated` to see what needs updating.  

Run the following to clean and reinstall: 

```bash
npm install --force
expo prebuild --clean
npm install
```

If using yarn:

```bash
yarn upgrade
expo prebuild --clean
yarn install
```

If you continue to encounter issues, use Expo's debugging utilities. For example, using the `expo prebuild` command can provide more insights into potential problems. If you're encountering an Expo SDK version mismatch, check the Expo release notes for any breaking changes and update accordingly. Consider creating a minimal reproducible example to simplify debugging.
